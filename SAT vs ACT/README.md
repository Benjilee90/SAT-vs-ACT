# Project 1: Analysis on SAt & ACT (2017 - 2018) 

## Problem Statement

The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. As an employee of the College Board, my team and I will be studying the statewide participation and results. Thereafter, providing recommendation where money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates.Apart from using SAT datasets, ACT datasets will be used as a comparison, to further understand its relation and implication to SAT.This will be done through statistical studies and presented in the form of slides and reports aiming to appraise the executives in the College Board as an effort to increase the participation rate in states where the rates are low.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Conclusions:_r than SAT.<br><br>

### Recommendations:


**Short-Term Goals**<br>

(1) Increased emphasis to SAT School Days:<br> 
SAT School Day offers graduating students to take their test in their school, on a weekday. It benefits the students as it is more convenient and the settings are familiar setting as they will be using the same location and staff for the test. Apart from that, fee waiver benefits will also be awarded to students with low-income families.<br>
- States with decreased participation rate year-on-year: District of Columbia has a 100% participation rate in 2017 but it was decreased to 92% in 2018
- States that has low participation rate in SAT: Tennessee, Oklahoma, Ohio <br><br> 

(2) Social Media Marketing:<br> 
No mandate certain states like Alaska. Hence, awareness for peaks of SAT should be spread to students<br> 
Advertising spreads awareness and postivity always bring postive results and carries positive influence. <br> 
Marketing Strategy:<br> 
(a)SAT's revamp, key differences between SAT and ACT:<br> 
- Eliminated testing of obscure vocabulary words
- Dropped the penalty for wrong answers
- More time to answer each question
(b)Highlight success stories through social media posts
- States with highest total score (Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota)
- State with 100% participation rate (Connecticut, Delaware and Michigan) <br><br>

**Long-Term Goals**<br>
Work towards mandating SAT at a state-level with College Boardâ€™s support for states without mandate on any particular test. 
As findings indicates that state mandates and policies impacts participation rates (example: States such as Mississippi, Missouri and Nebraska mandated ACT resulting in 100% participation rates for the test). With effort to push for mandating SAT, College Board can offer support like the situation in Illinois and Colorado where there was a successful transition from non-mandated to mandated SAT. <br>
Focus on states that does not mandate a particular test <br>
Potential targets: (1) Alaska, (2) Florida and (3) North Dakota<br>
Means: <br>
Additional subsidies to support the participants from low income families<br>
Offering free tuition classes to maintain/improve the state score<br><br>
